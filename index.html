		1. To start press anywhere on the game screen. </br>
		2. To Lock on target press anywhere on the game screen while the radar ray is pointing the enemy plane.</br>
		3. Next, you have to lock the range to the target by clicking anywhere on the screen, while the range indicator is above the enemy!</br>
		4. Then, the automated laser system will destroy the incomming threat, while you prepare to lock the next baddie.</br>
		5. Beware, the enemy planes are reported to carry tactical nuclear weapons. If they reach you: GAME OVER;
